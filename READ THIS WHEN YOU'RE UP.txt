I did a few things while you were away.

Weapons:
	- Upgaded the sprite for the Everglow Lantern, making it more of a torch
		- It looks nicer, check it out
	- Added an alternate sprite for Everglow Lantern with the chain on top
		- Should you manage to find a way for it to be held by the chain while I'm asleep, that'd be cool
		- No worries if you can't
	- Changed Everglow Lantern's recipe to require two souls instead of one
		- No more magic mitosis
		
Pets:
	- Slightly altered the Companion Soul tooltip to sound more profound

Pet Accessories:
	- Made a crown, both in Gold and Platinum variants
		- Flawless on all Cute Slimes except for Pink
		- Pink's pigtails slightly collide with the crown, though it's not super evident
	- All bows come in ten colors; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, White, Gray, and Black
	- All bowties come in ten colors; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, White, Gray, and Black
	- All magic staves are accounted for; Amber, Amethyst, Diamond, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, and Topaz
	- All head slimes include the following; Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Pinky (smaller than other hats), and Black
	- Santa Hat has a green variant now
	
	- I didn't put any of them in the game. I didn't want to make any mistakes, so that's your work.


Here's a few suggestions as well;

Dessicated Leather
	- Drop between 0 and 1 when the Harvester boss dies, since it's only used for the light pet
	
Sigil of Pain Suppression and Sigil of Retreat
	- Possibly have them drop from the Harvester boss instead of being crafted
