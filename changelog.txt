TBD

* FIXES:
    * Fixed Young Harpy being damageable even with Guide to Critter Companionship active
    * Fixed Infinity Rocket not working with Celebration MK2 and other fancy rocket launchers

* CHANGES:
    * Changed Animated Tome, Chunky, Meatball, Horned Slime, Ocean Slime, Sting Slime, and Turtle Slime to be actual critters with 5 health and 0 damage
    * Changed Breath of Spazmatism to match 1.4.4 Flamethrower visuals and stats. This results in a ~100% buff overall
