how to test out the accessories on the slimes:
search for "aaa" in items, it gives you two temporarily textured accessories (items)

left click with one anywhere and see your slime get that accessory

if you want to add more, go into Items/PetAccessories, read the .cs file for a guide
(note: only support for "body" slot accessories for now, and only the santa hat works only on the black slime properly)
