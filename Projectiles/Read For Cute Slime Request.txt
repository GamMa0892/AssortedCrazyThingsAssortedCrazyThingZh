The CuteSlime pngs in the "Projectiles\Pets\" folder are currently greyscale, and the originals are in the temp folder "Projectiles\Original Cute Slimes\". Disregard the Rainbow and Xmas variants, as they're good as is. Rainbow is fully opaque and has the rainbow effect you added, while the Xmas version is exactly the same as the NPC. All of the pets currently have the same opacity as their NPC counterparts, but not the overlay colors. If you can manage to make the overlays work and bring their pet variants to the same opacity as the NPC versions, that would be fantastic.

Black Overlay: (0, 0, 0, 50);
Blue Overlay; (0, 80, 255, 100);
Green Overlay; (0, 220, 40, 100);
Pink Overlay; (250, 30, 90, 90);
Purple Overlay; (200, 0, 255, 150);
Red Overlay; (255, 30, 0, 100);
Yellow Overlay: (255, 255, 0, 100);

Disregard Git saying that some things were renamed; I removed the new weapons and bar because they were silly and over the top, or just not ready to be used.
