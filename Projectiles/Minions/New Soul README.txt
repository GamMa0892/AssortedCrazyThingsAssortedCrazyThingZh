Last time, we briefly talked about upgraded lanterns and souls. I did some quickies for both, but I didn't know where to start on making the souls and items anywhere near as good as you've done. In this folder, there are 7 new sprites that go to two new lanterns. These are just ideas, and nothing set in concrete.

Hallowed Lantern (Items/Weapons/)
	- Summons three souls
		- Fright Soul
			- Higher damage overall?
		- Might Soul
			- Higher knockback?
		- Sight Soul
			- Charges at enemies faster?
	
Luminite Lantern (Items/Weapons/)
	- Summons four souls
		- Nebula Soul
			- Teleports to an enemy?
		- Solar Soul
			- Charges more frequently?
		- Stardust Soul
			- Can attack through walls?
		- Vortex Soul
			- ???
