- slime accessories apply just on left/right click, no need to mouseover the slime (also thats more effort on my end to do this,
because their hitboxes are all uniform while their scale/texture isn't)

- slime accessories only work if you have your bottled slime in the pet accessory slot (no worky when you just left click with the item)

- mention that the temporary minion has twice the damage of a regular soul, and that it lasts 10 seconds, and only one can be active at a time,
and that it has no cooldown (probably a copypaste leftover)

- mention that the sigils cooldown resets even when you unequip the accessory

- extendo net still needs a recipe (gated by skeletron, so bones or wires might be a good idea)

- mention that the limit of current "alive" souls is 10, so as long as you kill fast enough, the old ones will despawn leaving
the harvester with no food (or less)

- mention that the harvesters "progress" shows up as a green number that says how many souls it has to still eat until it evolves, when it eats one
(also mention that we recommend the mod "Player Resource Bars" that displays a health bar on the bird for easier tracking of progress)

- mention that sigil of emergency also increases minion damage by 10%

about CHANGES:

- change "All items' sell values updated" to ""Almost all items' sell values updated"


about the BUGS AND ISSUES part:

- rephrase the bug about the candles to: for particles that involve shooting things, it is only client side

- remove the "doesnt sync well" thing, its fixed

- remove the loose dungeon souls not upgrading and put it somewhere in their actual description, since its a "feature"
(refer to https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Etherian_Mana)
