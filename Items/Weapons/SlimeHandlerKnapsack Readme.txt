Here's a quick rundown of what the Slime Handler's Knapsack is all about;

* Slime Handler's Knapsack
	* ?? summon damage
	* Extremely weak knockback
	* Uses 10 mana
	* Throw a random slime from the knapsack to fight for you
		* Slime spawns from Player hand
		* No visible weapon sprite when used
		* Visual backpack on back at all times when holding the pack, similar to Heat Ray
	* Summoned Minions:
		* Random pick between any of the minion sprites in the Projectiles/Minions/SlimePack/ folder
		* All sprites share the same dimensions

Basically, a better Slime Staff for mid-late Hardmode based on my silly idea from a while ago about "throwing" slimes out of a backpack.
