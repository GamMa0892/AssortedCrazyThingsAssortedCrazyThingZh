(copypasted from the pastebin) Slime accessory specifics:

The so called "Spritesheet" is the image with all frames of that thing stacked up vertically. Base it off of the example accessories.

I suggest using a software that supports layers, and then put one of the slime girls as a refecence behind whatever accessory you are doing.

Keep in mind we won't change the dimensions of the spritesheet, so for things like shoes and hats you can do specify an offset (just tell me).
(Keep that offset consistent throughout each frame)

The zip will only contain the base sprites of the green and blue one as examples, a red bow, and a santa hat.
All slime girls have the same body, arms, wings, and head size.
The only thing that is different is the face and the hair. I suggest making accessories on the green slime girl because it has short hair and it doesn't block the accessories anywhere hopefully,
but they should all work on all slime girls.

Finally, what you should end up with is a spritesheet of the accessory, and also the sprite of the "item" (what you will have in your inventory).
The max size of it is 32x32 (or 16x16 1x1 pixels), and for the bigger accessories it won't fit in there properly, so keep that in mind and make a smaller texture of it that fits.
Examples of that in the "example accessories" folder. You can name them whatever, we will rename them properly when we integrate them into the mod later on.

For further questions and for actually sending the sprites in, do a pull request on git or whatever
