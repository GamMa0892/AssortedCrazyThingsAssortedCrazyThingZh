	- Compatibility with the mod "Player Resource Bars" allows you to see the current progress of its feast
	- Use a net to slow down Soul Harvester's feast, though it will throw bones at you if you try this when it's eating
	- After eating a few souls, it grows larger and more menacing
		- You can tell how many souls it has left before transforming after it eats a soul
		- The remaining amount required for its transformation is denoted with a green number that counts down
	- If it gorges itself even more, it will become a mass of flying bone and moss

	Bugs:
		- Soul Harvester's first stages might behave weirdly or get stuck in extreme circumstances
		- Everburning Candles' particles do not show up for other players in multiplayer when using ranged weapons
			- The effects still work just fine
	Compatibility:
		- No known compatibility issues yet
	Issues:
		- Due to the way Cute Rainbow Slime is colored, most accessories applied to it will cause graphical issues
		- Due to difficulty syncing in multiplayer, Cute Slime vanity items are client-side only
			- You will see others' Cute Slimes in their naked glory, no matter what they have equipped
			- This will be fixed in the future at some point
		- Empowerment Flask's effect is reset when you dodge damage, such as with the Master Ninja Gear
		- Loose Dungeon Souls don't upgrade into Freed Dungeon Souls when they are stored in a chest prior to Soul Harvester being defeated
			- This is similar to how Etherian Mana does not despawn when stored in chests
