Below are a few ideas that came to me for some hopefully simple things to do coding-wise. 


Happy New Year as well

1. Anomalous Wings working like wings underwater with great efficiency, but being useless out of water
	- They're anomalocaris lobes, not actual wings. I just couldn't make that before.
	- Provides absolutely no benefit when not submerged in water
	- Provides infinite wing time when submerged in water
	- Ignores water so the player moves at normal speed, like the Fishron Wings (I think I got that part done, I forgot)
	
2. Accessory of some kind that makes you bounce when falling, much like when landing on pink slime blocks
	- Original goal I dropped prior to getting help
	- Boot equip slot
	- Probably crafted with two Leather and Pink Gel or Pink Slime Blocks
	- I'll do the sprites later
	
3. Accessory that uses a recall potion when your health is dangerously low
	- Effect has an internal cooldown or a debuff of some kind so it doesn't happen constantly
	- I'll do the sprites later

4. Accessory that grants you extremely high defense for a very short time with a high internal cooldown when your health is dangerously low
	- Cooldown similar to the Sun Dial in that it won't work for a few ingame days
	- If you could make it percent based, that would be neat
		- Otherwise, a low amount of health like 20 or so would probably suffice
	- Combines with #3
	
5. Accessory that combines the effects of #3 and #4
	- I can do this myself if you make the above two, but if you made it after doing those, I wouldn't complain
	
5. Juggerllusc picking random colors to spawn with instead of being three separate NPCs
	- Really, I'm not sure why neither of us brought this up by now considering the Animated Tome did the exact same thing
	
6. Proper animation for the pet "GobletPet" in Projectiles
	- Frame 1 is idle, frames 2-7 are walking, frame 8 is jumping, remaining four are flying
	- Minimal rotation while flying, rotor should almost always be at the top
	- All the other files necessary for it to be a pet are saves as .txt files;

		- GobletItem.png - /Items/Pets/
		- GobletItem.txt - /Items/Pets/
		- GobletBuff.png - /Buffs/
		- GobletBuff.txt - /Buffs/
