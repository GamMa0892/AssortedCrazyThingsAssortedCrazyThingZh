I know I said four frames when we initially made the idea, but I absolutely had to do 8. The frames are as such;

0 - Inactive
1 - Active, leads to 2
2 - Active, leads to 3
3 - Active, leads to 4
4 - Active, leads to 5
5 - Active, leads to 6
6 - Active, leads to 7
7 - Active, leads to 8
8 - Active, repeats from 1

Filename is not final; let's come up with a suitable name for this silly thing.
