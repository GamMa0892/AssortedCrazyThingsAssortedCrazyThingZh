Proposed Idea:
	When using Head Slot items for Cute Slime pets, pick a sprite that matches the pet sprite. For example, Pink's pigtails cause issues with all current hats, so use the variant of the hat sprite assigned to her below. Each hat has been given sprites that fit specific Cute Slimes, some covering more than others. The instructions below will say how much offset is needed, as well as which sprite goes to who. Likewise, I have provided the sprites for all Slime girls with updated head shapes; this was for it to be easier on me to sprite them, as well as for the hats to fit on more than one girl with as few issues as possible. Feel free to rename the sprites as needed.
	
	I only listed Rainbow for completion's sake; I know she can't be equipped due to the way she's set up

	
Hats:
	Crown
		- No need to offset
		- Sprites match t he hair contours
			- 01_Draw is meant for Black and Purple
			- 02_Draw is meant for Blue, Green, Rainbow, and Red
			- 03_Draw is meant for Pink
			- 04_Draw is meant for Yellow

	Xmas
		- Offset the hats up by 4
		- Causes Cute Slime pets to use the "NoHair" variant of their projectile sprite, if available
			- Example; Purple does not have a NoHair sprite, but Black does
		- Three different sprites to match the hair contours
			- 01_Draw is meant for Black and Purple
			- 02_Draw is meant for Blue, Green, Rainbow, Red, and Yellow
			- 03_Draw is meant for Pink
