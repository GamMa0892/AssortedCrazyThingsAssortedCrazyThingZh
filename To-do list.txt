direwolf420 to-do list

1. Anomalous Wings working like wings underwater with great efficiency, but being useless out of water
	- They're anomalocaris lobes, not actual wings. I just couldn't make that before.
	- Provides absolutely no benefit when not submerged in water
	- Provides infinite wing time when submerged in water
	- Ignores water so the player moves at normal speed, like the Fishron Wings (I think I got that part done, I forgot)
	
2. Accessory of some kind that makes you bounce when falling, much like when landing on pink slime blocks
	- Original goal I dropped prior to getting help
	- Boot equip slot
	- Probably crafted with two Leather and Pink Gel or Pink Slime Blocks
	- I'll do the sprites later
	
//DONE
3. Accessory that uses a recall potion when your health is dangerously low
	- Effect has an internal cooldown or a debuff of some kind so it doesn't happen constantly
	- I'll do the sprites later

//DONE
4. Accessory that grants you extremely high defense for a very short time with a high internal cooldown when your health is dangerously low
	- Cooldown similar to the Sun Dial in that it won't work for a few ingame days
	- If you could make it percent based, that would be neat
		- Otherwise, a low amount of health like 20 or so would probably suffice
	- Combines with #3
	
//DONE
5. Accessory that combines the effects of #3 and #4
	- I can do this myself if you make the above two, but if you made it after doing those, I wouldn't complain
	
//DONE
5. Juggerllusc picking random colors to spawn with instead of being three separate NPCs
	- Really, I'm not sure why neither of us brought this up by now considering the Animated Tome did the exact same thing
	
//DONE
6. Proper animation for the pet "GobletPet" in Projectiles
	- Frame 1 is idle, frames 2-7 are walking, frame 8 is jumping, remaining four are flying
	- Minimal rotation while flying, rotor should almost always be at the top
	- All the other files necessary for it to be a pet are saves as .txt files;
		- GobletPet.png - /Projectiles/Pets/
		- GobletItem.png - /Items/Pets/
		- GobletItem.txt - /Items/Pets/
		- GobletBuff.png - /Buffs/
		- GobletBuff.txt - /Buffs/

//DONE
7. Apply Slow to player when he collides with the Harvester
	- (without enabling it to attack you)
	- maybe change it to auto targeting with a variable range depending on what stage it is in
	- clone the bones projectile and apply slow debuff

//DONE
8. Make that empowering potion
	- uses dungeon souls for crafting
	- makes your stats better the more kills you get during its buff duration

9. Proper fadein/fadeout when harvester is transforming

10. Make third stage Harvester AI
	- Should move like queen bee "fly above player" mode
	- uses his claws like golem fists
	- drops bones, souls
	- souls can be crafted into various gear, water candle, potion

Werebearguy to-do list

1. Before release, go through every file
	- set DisplayName accordingly
	- set appropriate recipes for every item (if needed)
	- so things like "aaaDungeonSoul" are just "Dungeon Soul"
	- also check if tooltips actually describe what that item does properly

2. Have a few more slime accessories on the next release
	- make atleast one for every slot so I can test it properly soon-ish tho

3. Prepare a "slime accessory template pack" kinda thing
	- with guidelines on how to draw them properly, what dimensions, what to do if accessory is out of bounds, etc etc
	- also let the person making it decide on an accessory slot (we still havent decided which ones make sense)
	- [Hat, Body, Hands, Tail] are those that I thought would make the most sense (maybe replace tail with sth else idk)
	- (I'll do the coding work, tho it should really be just copy paste)

//DONE
4. Remove the Companion Balloon Soul Accessory Thing (if you want)
	- Since we got a light pet I think this'll be useless as it doesn't animate properly

5. Dungeon Soul armor
	- Make the Dungeon Soul armor craftable with standard skeletron tier resources, has similar stats to Necro armor (same tier)
	- Make a hardmode version of it where you upgrade each armor with ectoplasm, gets crazier texture and slightly better stats than
	the chlorophyte version of the Chlorophyte Headgear set
	- set bonus is more minion slots and only TWO small souls that attack similar to the spaz-twin minion (I'll do the code)

//DONE
6. Textures for the requests in 3 and 4 (direwolf420s)

//DONE
7. Texture for the aaaSoulLightPetBuff
